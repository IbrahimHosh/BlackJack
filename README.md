# BlackJack
Blackjack is a card game in which the player is dealt two cards from a regular 52-card deck, with the goal of increasing the value of your hand without reaching 21. The sum of the various card values is the 'value' of the hand: The 2-9 cards are worth "face value" (2-9 points), the 10, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points apiece, and the Ace is worth 1 or 11 depending on the best count.
